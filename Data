Data

To solve this problem, I will need below data:

List of neighborhoods in Toronto, Canada.
Latitude and Longitude of these neighborhoods.
Venue data related to Asian restaurants. This will help us find the neighborhoods that are most suitable to open a Chinese restaurant.
Extracting the data

Scrapping of Toronto neighborhoods via Wikipedia
Getting Latitude and Longitude data of these neighborhoods via Geocoder package
Using Foursquare API to get venue data related to these neighborhoods
