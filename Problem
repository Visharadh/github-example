Introduction

For this Capstone project, I am creating a hypothetical scenario for a concept Chinese restaurateur who wants to explore opening an authentic Chinese restaurant in Toronto area. The idea behind this project is that there may not be enough Chinese restaurants in Toronto and it might present a great opportunity for this entrepreneur who is based in Canada. As Chinese food is very similar to other Asian cuisines, this entrepreneur is thinking of opening this restaurant in locations where Asian food is popular (aka many Asian restaurants in the neighborhood). With the purpose in mind, finding the location to open such a restaurant is one of the most important decisions for this entrepreneur and I am designing this project to help him find the most suitable location.

Business Problem

The objective of this capstone project is to find the most suitable location for the entrepreneur to open a new Chinese restaurant in Toronto, Canada. By using data science methods and machine learning methods such as clustering, this project aims to provide solutions to answer the business question: In Toronto, if an entrepreneur wants to open a Burmese restaurant, where should they consider opening it?
